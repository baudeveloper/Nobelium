							<h2>Corporate Mission and Strategy</h2>
							<p>We seek to compound shareholder capital at attractive per share rates over the long-term by prudently acquiring and building a collection of high-quality vertical market software (“VMS”) businesses and continuously reinvesting their cash earnings.</p>
							<p>We believe that applying a disciplined capital allocation model to the VMS industry creates opportunity for above average shareholder returns.</p>
							<p>Growing our invested capital per share by acquiring new companies and reinvesting in them, and adhering to a disciplined IRR and cash payback model on deployed capital is our core focus. </p>
							<p>Nobelium aims to grow annual acquisition capital deployed by at least 25% per year.</p>
							<p>In so doing, Nobelium seeks to…</p>
							<ul class="cl arrow">
								<li>provide a permanent home for high-quality VMS businesses</li>
								<li>become an acquirer of choice status in the VMS industry</li>
								<li>own a predictable and growing set of cash flows from operating businesses</li>
								<li>leverage earnings shields; non-cash amortization and legacy tax losses</li>
							</ul>
							<p>…which it believes are attractive and sustainable competitive advantages.</p>
